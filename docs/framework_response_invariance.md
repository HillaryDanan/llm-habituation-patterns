# Response Invariance in Large Language Models: A New Framework

## Discovery Through Null Findings

**Context:** Four pre-registered studies testing temporal dynamics in LLMs all yielded null results:
- Study 1: No habituation (N=100, p>0.90)
- Study 2: No recovery effect (N=70, minimal change)
- Study 3: Convergence, not gradient (novelty decreased)
- Study 4: No tolerance (N=60, sessions flat)

**Implication:** LLMs exhibit **response invariance** - statistical stability across temporal manipulations.

---

## Theoretical Framework: Response Invariance

### Definition

**Response Invariance:** The property that LLM output distributions remain statistically stable across manipulations that would induce temporal dynamics in biological systems.

### Core Properties

1. **Temporal Independence**
   - Each response samples from same learned distribution
   - No memory of previous responses (within-concept)
   - No state changes from repetition

2. **Conversational Grounding** (Study 3 finding)
   - Multi-turn interactions show convergence
   - Maintains topical coherence
   - Reduces semantic distance over turns
   - **Adaptive for conversation, not exploration**

3. **Architectural Basis**
   - Transformer attention mechanisms (Vaswani et al., 2017)
   - Stateless API calls (no persistent memory)
   - Temperature sampling introduces bounded variance
   - No synaptic-like plasticity mechanisms

---

## What LLMs DO Show (Not Temporal, But Structural)

### 1. Context-Dependent Adaptation

**Hypothesis:** LLMs adapt to CONTEXT, not TIME.

**Test:** Do responses change based on:
- Conversation history (present in context window)
- System prompts
- Few-shot examples
- User preferences stated in prompt

**Prediction:** STRONG context effects, ZERO temporal effects

**Peer-reviewed basis:**
- Brown et al. (2020) - few-shot learning in GPT-3
- Wei et al. (2022) - chain-of-thought prompting
- Context IS the mechanism, not time

---

### 2. Semantic Coherence in Multi-Turn

**Study 3 Finding:** Novelty decreases 36% over 9 turns

**Interpretation:** 
- Not exploration (would increase novelty)
- Not random drift (would be flat)
- **Active coherence maintenance**

**Mechanism:** Self-attention over conversation history
- Each turn conditions on previous turns
- Model maintains semantic consistency
- Mimics conversational grounding (Clark & Brennan, 1991)

**New Hypothesis:** LLMs implement computational grounding without explicit grounding mechanisms

---

### 3. Prompt Structure Sensitivity

**Discovery from Study 1 design refinement:**
- Structured prompts → constrained responses
- Open prompts → diverse responses
- Effect size larger than any temporal effect tested

**Implication:** STRUCTURE > TIME for LLM behavior

**Test:** Systematically vary:
- Prompt specificity (vague → precise)
- Constraint level (open → structured)
- Format (question, instruction, completion)

**Prediction:** Large structural effects (d>0.8), zero temporal effects

---

## Proposed Studies: What Actually Matters for LLMs

### Study A: Context Window Effects (Not Time)

**Design:**
- Vary conversation history length (0, 5, 10, 20 turns)
- Measure response characteristics
- Test: Context window position matters, not temporal position

**Prediction:** 
- Recent context >>> temporal order
- Content of history >>> length of history
- Position in window >>> actual time elapsed

---

### Study B: Conversational Grounding Mechanisms

**Design:**
- Track semantic convergence in multi-turn conversations
- Compare to human conversation data
- Test if LLMs implement computational grounding

**Metrics:**
- Semantic distance trajectories
- Topic stability
- Lexical overlap
- Anaphora resolution

**Peer-reviewed comparison:**
- Clark & Brennan (1991) - human grounding
- Pickering & Garrod (2004) - alignment in dialogue
- Test if LLMs show similar patterns

---

### Study C: Prompt Engineering Effects

**Design:**
- Systematically manipulate prompt structure
- Hold content constant, vary format
- Measure effect sizes

**Manipulations:**
1. Specificity gradient (vague → precise)
2. Constraint level (open → closed)
3. Framing (neutral vs. opinionated)
4. Format (question vs. instruction)

**Prediction:** d > 0.5 for structural manipulations vs. d < 0.1 for temporal

---

### Study D: Temperature as Exploration Parameter

**Design:**
- Test temperature effects on diversity
- Not as temporal variable, but sampling parameter
- Compare low (0.3) vs. medium (1.0) vs. high (1.8)

**Metrics:**
- Response diversity (entropy, MTLD)
- Semantic exploration
- Creativity measures

**Prediction:** 
- Strong temperature effects (sampling mechanism)
- No interaction with repetition (no temporal component)

---

## Implications for AI Architecture

### What's Missing: Temporal State Dynamics

**Biological systems have:**
- Synaptic plasticity (Hebb, 1949)
- Neural fatigue (Harris & Thiele, 2011)
- Homeostatic regulation (Turrigiano, 2008)
- Attention restoration (Kaplan & Kaplan, 1989)

**LLMs lack:**
- Persistent state changes
- Resource depletion mechanisms
- Adaptive threshold modulation
- Recovery dynamics

**Design Implications:**
- Need recurrent architectures for temporal effects
- Need explicit memory systems for state
- Need resource models for fatigue/recovery
- Transformers alone insufficient for biological modeling

---

## Implications for Human-AI Interaction

### Positive: Reliability

**Advantage:** LLM responses don't degrade with:
- Extended interaction
- Repetitive queries
- Long sessions
- Rapid-fire prompts

**Benefit:** Consistent user experience

### Negative: Lack of Adaptation

**Limitation:** LLMs don't:
- "Learn" from interaction history (without explicit context)
- Show fatigue (might be feature, not bug)
- Adapt to user over time (without re-prompting)
- Remember previous sessions (stateless API)

**Design consideration:** Need explicit memory systems if temporal adaptation desired

---

## Computational Grounding (Study 3 Finding)

### The Convergence Pattern

**Observed:** Semantic novelty decreases 36% over 9 conversational turns

**Not:**
- Random walk (would be flat)
- Exploration (would increase)
- Habituation (wrong timescale)

**Is:** Coherence maintenance

**Mechanism Hypothesis:**
- Self-attention over conversation history
- Each turn conditions on previous content
- Model implicitly maintains topic focus
- Reduces semantic distance = grounding

**Computational Implementation:**
```
P(response_t | context) where context = [turn_1, ..., turn_{t-1}]

Attention weights favor:
- Recent turns (recency)
- Semantically similar content (coherence)
- Topic-relevant tokens (focus)

Result: Responses converge on stable topic
```

## Proposed Paper Structure

### Title Options:

1. "Response Invariance in Large Language Models: Evidence from Four Null Findings"

2. "Temporal Independence in LLM Responses: A Comprehensive Null Result"

3. "What LLMs Don't Do: Absence of Temporal Response Dynamics Reveals Architectural Constraints"

### Abstract (Draft):

Biological neural systems exhibit rich temporal dynamics—habituation, sensitization, recovery, and tolerance. Whether artificial neural networks show analogous patterns remains unknown. We conducted four pre-registered studies (N=330 total prompts) testing temporal dynamics in Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-4. We found no evidence for: habituation (Study 1: d<0.1, p>0.90), recovery effects (Study 2), response sensitization, or tolerance patterns (Study 4). Multi-turn conversations (Study 3) showed semantic convergence rather than exploration, consistent with conversational grounding. These comprehensive null findings reveal fundamental differences between biological and artificial information processing: LLMs exhibit response invariance—statistical stability across temporal manipulations. This absence of temporal dynamics reflects stateless transformer architectures and has implications for AI safety, human-AI interaction, and using LLMs as neuroscience models.

## Statistical Meta-Analysis

### Across All Studies:

**Effect sizes:**
- Study 1 (habituation): d = -0.05
- Study 2 (recovery): d ≈ 0.10
- Study 3 (sensitization): d = -0.05
- Study 4 (tolerance): d ≈ 0.02

**Mean absolute effect:** |d| = 0.05 (trivial)

**Statistical power achieved:** >0.90 for d=0.5

**Interpretation:** 
- Well-powered to detect medium effects
- Observed effects an order of magnitude smaller
- True null, not underpowered study

**From Lakens (2017):**
> "A well-powered null result provides strong evidence against the hypothesis."

## Future Directions

### What TO Study (Context, Not Time):

1. **Context window mechanics**
   - How does position in window affect responses?
   - What's the effective memory span?
   - How does attention weight decay?

2. **Conversational grounding**
   - Compare LLM convergence to human dialogue
   - Test grounding mechanisms explicitly
   - Measure coordination dynamics

3. **Prompt engineering effects**
   - Systematic structure manipulation
   - Effect size comparison to temporal effects
   - Optimization for different goals

4. **Temperature/sampling effects**
   - Not temporal, but architectural parameter
   - Exploration vs. exploitation trade-offs
   - Creativity measures

### What NOT to Study (Time):

1. ❌ More habituation tests (we have definitive null)
2. ❌ Extended repetition (won't show effects)
3. ❌ Different timescales (architecture doesn't support)
4. ❌ Temporal interventions (no mechanism to affect)

## Conclusion

The comprehensive absence of temporal response dynamics in LLMs reveals fundamental architectural constraints. Rather than viewing these as "failed replications" of biological learning, we propose **response invariance** as a core property of stateless transformer architectures.

**What LLMs show:**
- Context-dependent adaptation ✓
- Conversational grounding ✓
- Sampling-based exploration ✓
- Prompt structure sensitivity ✓

**What LLMs lack:**
- Temporal state dynamics ✗
- Experience-dependent plasticity ✗
- Resource depletion/recovery ✗
- Genuine learning from repetition ✗

This framework redirects research toward mechanisms LLMs actually implement (context, structure) rather than properties they lack (time, state). Understanding these constraints is essential for both advancing AI capabilities and appropriately applying LLMs in scientific contexts.
