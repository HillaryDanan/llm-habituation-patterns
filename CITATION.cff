abstract: >
  A systematic investigation into whether large language models exhibit
  behavioral patterns functionally analogous to habituation and 
  stimulation-seeking behaviors observed in biological systems. This work
  measures objective, testable patterns while maintaining scientific honesty
  about limitations of anthropomorphic comparisons.
